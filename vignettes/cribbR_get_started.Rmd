 (The package was first to be named `cheatR`, but it was already taken.)

## What are snippets?
Snippets are a function in R-studio that provides 'snippets' (also known as "boilerplate code"). Chunks of code that you are likely to type often.

A useful default example is 'lib' which gives you 'library()' and puts the cursor in within the brackets.

But snippets becomes truly useful when you start to tailor make them to suit yourself!

Unfortunately (well, not a big thing, really), the file containing your snippets is not created until you start to modify the defaults.

## How to activate the custom snippets:
To 'create' the file, open the menu tools > Global options

Select 'Code' in the left column and cross 'Enable snippets'.

Click 'Edit snippets...' and add a blank line at the end. Then save. Close all menus.")

## Make snippets easily accesible:

The `cribbR` package has (of course) a function to locate your snippets file, and add a snippet called `edit_snippets`. When this is added you can easily add access your snippets when ever you want, and add or update easily.

```
library(cribbR) # If you already have snippets activated you just have to type 'lib' and then hit tab!

# In the simplest form, just run this command and follow the instructions.
let_there_be_snippets()

```

When you have included the `edit_snippets`, it might now show up directly. It is a little bit unclear when R-studio loads the updated version. The easiest way to proceed is to restart R-studio the first time.
